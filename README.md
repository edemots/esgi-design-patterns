# Design Patterns

## Directories

### `/slides`

You will find in this directory all the slides of the course in HTML, PDF and Markdown.
Slides are made thanks to [marpit](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit).

### `/src`

This directory contains all the TPs of the course, corrected in class.

## Getting started

You'll need to install composer dependencies in order to run the tps

To do so run in your terminal :
```sh
composer install
```
